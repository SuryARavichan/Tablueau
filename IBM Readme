About
This project aims to visualize various aspects of a company's HR data, enabling stakeholders to understand employee demographics, performance, attrition trends, compensation, and training effectiveness. The dashboard helps in identifying patterns, potential areas of concern, and opportunities for improvement in HR policies and practices.

It was developed as part of [YOUR INPUT HERE: e.g., a data analytics portfolio project, a course assignment, an internal company initiative].

Data Source
The data used for this dashboard is a fictional or anonymized HR dataset, titled hr_data.csv.
